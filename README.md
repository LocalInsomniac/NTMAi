# SUMMARY
Here's a mod of mine that's been the works since summer 2019. This is a mod that takes the charm of Build Engine games such as Duke Nukem 3D, Shadow Warrior and Blood and attempts to do the same principles for Doom. I've even gone so far to replace most of the object sprites to 1.5x upscaled sprites based on hidfan's Neural Upscaled sprites, and ensuring that there are no more than only 5 rotations for every monster sprite. Right now this mod is in a version below 1.0, so it's pretty barebones, although I'd consider it pretty much complete for a first release.

# FEATURES
What's a Doom mod gotta do to be Build-styled? Here's a list:

	-Some cool resources by Kinsie (Title & intermission background, sounds)
	-Less slippery movement, sprite shadows and blood & gore system made by Nash
	-Higher resolution monster graphics, nicer explosions and some sound caulking
	-More dynamic camera movement: flinching, shaking, head flies off when gibbed...
	-Angled weapons courtesy of Angled Doom and Bullet puff sounds depending on what kind of weapon you use (fist, chainsaw, gun)
	-A quick reloadable pistol, hand grenades, a Super Shotgun that blasts enemies far away and a BFG 9000 that recoils...
	-Unique alt-fires for weapons that require different ammo (explosive shells for shotgun, homing rockets for rocket launcher, rail beam for plasma rifle...)
	-Impactful power-ups (soulsphere, invulnerability sphere...), some items are now used through the inventory (berserk, infrared...)
	-Blood-styled movement for monsters
	-New monster abilities: jumping over pits, jumping at enemies, charging at the player, added missing melee states...

And other things I forgot about! Some of these things like camera moves, weapon functions & jumping monsters can be adjusted through NTMAI Options.
